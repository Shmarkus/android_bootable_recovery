{"name":"Android bootable recovery","tagline":"CWM port for Rockchip devices","body":"### Welcome to CWM Rockchip port\r\nThis project is modification of stock ClockWorkMod for Rockchip devices. Since RK devices can not use IOCTL MEMERASE properly for some reason a workaround is needed. I merged this workaround from stock recovery found on radxa github page to recovery used in CyanogenMod.\r\n\r\nRight now only cm10.1 and jellybean-stable branches are updated, although this update is easy to apply on other branches when necessary! \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n- Fetch CM from Github (plenty of examples in the internet).\r\n- edit manifest file so that this recovery is used instead of CyagenMods default recovery\r\n- Build and have fun doing backups and flashing new ROMs\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\nSpecial thanks goes to CyanogenMod team (@CyanogenMod), Koush (@koush) and Radxa for stock recovery sources (http://wiki.radxa.com/Rock/Android_Build). Also I received much support from Freaktab forums!\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf You have any questions contact me: markuskarileet@hotmail.com (@Shmarkus)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
